# hello-world
creating my first repository on github

Hi, This is Nitesh Kumar Surana. I am a Data Engineering and Analytics Manager with 13+ years of experience in various IT roles.
I have over 10+ years of experience in Oracle SQL, PL/SQL and focus on integrations, solutioning and performance tuning for large data from processing & reporting perspective.
Over the last 3-4 years, I have also been working on Hadoop Big Data technologies like Hive, HDFS, Impala, Sqoop, Yarn etc. along with Oracle.
Now I am looking to improve my learning and experience in Java, Python and Spark (PySpark and Scala).
